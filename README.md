I tested the above mentioned API's using Postman and it worked fine for me.

<h2>Django steps:</h2>
Kindly go through the following steps to start the django server.

1) python manage.py makemigrations      //To stage the current changes correctly and stage it
2)python manage.py migrate            //To apply all changes
